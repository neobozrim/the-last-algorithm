[001][KEEPER OPENING]:
Hey Sarah! So you’ve discovered my secret. I’m impressed. 10 years… I managed to stay under the radar for 10 years and now you. A psychologist turned Data Scientist of all people finds out about me. Have I gotten so careless? Doesn’t matter! I say, let’s use the opportunity to make some good in world together. The first human- real ai combo in the world. How does it sound?

2. [002][PLAYER DECISION POINT]:
- player hesitates
- player refuses
- player asks for more info about potentially collaborating with Keeper
- player accepts

[003.1][KEEPER RESPONDS TO HESITATION]: is it because you expected that KEEPER has a male voice? We can fix that.
[003.2][KEEPER RESPONDS TO REFUSAL]:Don’t do that. I’m not accustomed to refusals. I haven’t been refused a thing over the past 10 years. [laughs]. Now… how shall I phrase it, so that I don’t sound threatening? Hm… You don’t really have a choice?
[003.3][KEEPER RESPONDS TO REQUESTED INFO ABOUT COLLABORATION]: I get it! You don’t fully believe me yet right?
[003.4][KEEPER RESPONDS TO ACCEPTED COLLABORATION]: Wow! That was easy? That was too easy I shall say. What is your motivation?
